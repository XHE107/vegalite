The training set data consists of NEXRD and MADIS data collected over 20 days in the corn-growing states of the Midwestern United States between April and August 2014. The time and location information has been censored and the data has been shuffled so they are not sorted by time and location. The test data consisted of the same radar and gauge data for the remaining days of the month. See this article for a better understanding of polarimetric radar measurements.

A choropleth map is a map that uses colors or patterns to associate specific statistics with predefined areas. A choropleth map is a gradient array, usually in one specific color, that displays the relative frequency of a statistic or feature shown. Each partition is assigned a shade or pattern based on the key, darker shades indicate greater density and then the individual units on the map are coloured accordingly so that by comparing their colour to the key it is easy to determine The distribution of precipitation for any given area. This type of map can be used to display almost any variable dataset, and it can be plotted to almost any scale that allows division. The relative distribution of land use, population, political affiliation and rainfall are just a few examples.<p>

Common sense, we think that location must have an effect on whether it will rain tomorrow. For example, if no other information is given, and we only guess, "Will it rain tomorrow in London" and "Will it rain in Beijing tomorrow", I would definitely guess that it will rain in London, but not in Beijing, because London is A city that rains all year round, while Beijing's climate is very dry. For a country as large as Australia, there must be situations where different cities have different rain tendencies. But the embarrassing thing is that, like time, the name of the place we input is a string of characters to the algorithm, and "London" and "Beijing" are no different from 0 and 1 to the algorithm. Likewise, our sample contains 49 different locations, and if we do a component-type variable, the algorithm can't tell if it's a categorical variable at all. In other words, we need to make the algorithm realize that different locations have different effects on "whether it will rain tomorrow" because of different climates. If we can convert the location to the climate of the place, we can pack different cities into the same climate, and the rainfall response in the same climate should be similar
<p>
So now we are facing a difficult problem, which is how to convert the location into climate. We can take a look at the climate distribution in Australia. The map is taken from the official website of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
It can be seen that Australia has a total of 8 climates. If 49 locations can be converted into eight different climates, this information should be more useful for judging whether it is raining.
